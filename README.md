# InfectiousPathogenDetector
IPD is an in-silico GUI-based automated pathogen analysis pipeline for seamless analysis of data from heterogenous NGS platforms. IPD performs integrated variants analysis, along with systematic quantification of pathogen genomes. IPD additionally has an in-built SARS-CoV-2 analysis module, for assignment of viral clades of the samples analyzed and an automated report generation. IPD (v 1.0) will not be further developed or maintained. We recomment using [IPD 2.0](https://github.com/sanket-desai/InfectiousPathogenDetector2) in your analysis.

### Documentation
Refer to README from the "doc" directory for detailed documentation on installation and usage of IPD. For any issues related to IPD usage, you may contact <desai.sanket12@gmail.com>.
